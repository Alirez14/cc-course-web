# Chapter 6: extra topic: testing

materials: [presentation: automated testing in JavaScript](https://marko-knoebl.github.io/slides/javascript-testing-en.html) (until "end-to-end tests with cypress")

exercise:

In previous exercises, you've already created a bunch of functions where you use _map_, _filter_, _reduce_, _spread_, ...

Write some tests for these functions!

E2E exercises:

- Create a new Cypress project and select "Scaffold example specs" - look through the example tests for the todo app at https://example.cypress.io/todo - then, try to recreate the tests in a separate file
- Create a Cypress project that tests existing websites (e.g. _Wikipedia_, _Amazon_)
- Create a Cypress project that tests an app that you have created
