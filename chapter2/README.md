# Chapter 2: overview

## Express

This chapter is about _express_, which can be used to create the back-end (server side) of an application

Express can send _responses_ for incoming HTTP _requests_

what can _express_ be used for:

- serving _static_ files (e.g. HTML, CSS, images, ...)
- providing server-generated pages (via _templating_)
- **providing an API** (this will be our main use case)

other topics in this chapter:

- reading / writing files with the _fs_ module (e.g. _fs.readFileSync_, _fs.writeFileSync_)
- using _postman_ to send HTTP requests
