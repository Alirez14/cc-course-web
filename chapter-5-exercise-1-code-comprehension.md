# Exercise: "The Employees": Code comprehension

Go through the starter code of the _employees_ exercise from Journey on your own.

Note down which parts are most difficult / challenging to understand for you.

When you're done, form groups of 2 and discuss your findings. Try to help each other out with understanding difficult parts in the code. Then, make a list together that has items which are still difficult for both of you.

Now, form bigger groups - e.g. 2 -> 4 -> 8.

In the end, discuss your findings with your mentor.
