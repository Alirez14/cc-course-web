# evolution of the web

phase 1: original architecture of the web:

- static content
- requests and responses
- first website: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

phase 2: rich back-end

- content generated "dynamically" on each request
- data saved in databases on the back-end
- data can be sent to the server via _form submissions_ -> server generates new HTML content and sends it to the browser

phase 3: dynamic front-end

- content on the front-end is dynamic
- data saved in databases
- front-end communicates with the back-end via an _API_
