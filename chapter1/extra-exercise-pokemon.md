# Exercise: Pokemon

use this API query to get the names of the first 10 pokemon:

```
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=10
```

Show the names in the HTML document.

The user can click on a name. Then, the list of 10 pokemon should disappear and more detailed information about that one pokemon should be shown. Also, there should be a "back" button that goes back to the overview list.
