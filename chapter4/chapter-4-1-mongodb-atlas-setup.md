# MongoDB Atlas setup

## Options

Options to set up and use mongoDB:

- install on your computer (only for development)
- host on the web - e.g. via atlas (can be used for development and for production)

## Setup

follow the **first part** of the guide at: https://journey.study/v2/learn/materials/tutorials/setting-up-atlas.md

**notes concerning the guide**:

You only need to do the part "Create Cluster" - you don't have to do "Connect to the Cluster"

You can use a rather simple username (e.g. _admin_ or _root_) and simple password for your account as we won't be storing "important" data

Instead of adding your current IP address, you can also just **allow access from anywhere** - especially if your data is not critical / valuable
