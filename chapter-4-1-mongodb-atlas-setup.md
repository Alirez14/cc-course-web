# Options

Options to set up and use mongoDB:

- install on your computer (only for development)
- host on the web - e.g. via atlas (can be used for development and for production)

# MongoDB Atlas setup

follow the guide at: https://journey.study/v2/learn/materials/tutorials/setting-up-atlas.md

**notes concerning the guide**:

You can use a rather simple username (e.g. _admin_ or _root_) and simple password for your account as we won't be storing "important" data

Instead of adding your current IP address, you can also just **allow access from anywhere** - especially if your data is not critical / valuable

The guide tells you to install _Compass_ - which is a desktop application for managing mongo. This is not necessary - as it's not used in the exercises / tasks.

Instead of using _Compass_ to connect to the database, you can choose the option "connect your application" and copy the URL from there for later use
