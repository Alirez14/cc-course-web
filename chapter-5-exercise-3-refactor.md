# Extra exercise: Refactor

You can do this on your own or as a team

All of the tasks are optional - Do those tasks which will make it **easier** for you to work with the code

## Suggested Tasks (all optional - you decide what you want to change!)

- pick clearer names instead of _EmployeeList_ and _EmployeeTable_
- split backend routes into different files, e.g.: _routes/employees.js_ and (in the future) _routes/equipments.js_
- change the frontend code so it uses _async_ / _await_ instead of _.then_
- create some custom components for styling (e.g. _Button_, _CompactButton_, _TextField_, ...)
- write some comments and "documentation comments" (`/** ... */`) for complicated code
- change the backend code so it uses _import_ / _export_ instead of _require_
- change the _EmployeeForm_ so it uses internal _state_ for the inputs (use _value_ and _onChange_ on the inputs instead of _defaultValue_); if an employee is passed into the form component as a prop, it should be used to initialize the state
- ... (come up with your own refactor tasks - share your ideas in the discord channel)
