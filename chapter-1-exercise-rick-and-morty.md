# Exercise: Rick and Morty

use the API here to display characters and locations: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character

basic structure of the page:

```html
<body>
  <button>home</button>
  <div class="main">
    <div class="character-list">...</div>
    <div class="location-list">...</div>
  </div>
</body>
```

on the home page, display a list of the first 20 characters and the first 20 locations (just the names)

when a list item is clicked, remove everything from the _main_ element and replace it with more detailed information about the character / location
